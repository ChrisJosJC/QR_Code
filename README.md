## My process

I can't say that was a hard project cause' I have a little bit of experience with this techs and is very easy for me (HTML and CSS) but for I understand the FrontendMentor's platform was really good.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Customs vars on CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Really, my knowledge about the media queries CSS was very good, cause' I don't use generally, but here I did and was a good way of train.

```css
@media (min-width: 1355px) {
  .card {
    max-width: 22vw;
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Custom variables on CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me for use the custom variables that was on the [style guide](./style-guide.md) .
